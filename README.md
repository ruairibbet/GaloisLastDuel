# Galois Last Duel - an open source musical.
A community written musical telling the tale of the life of [Evariste Galois](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois).
The plot is intended to be fairly accurate to his life with a little artistic license for the stage. 
We intend to stage the musical in Oxford following the run of ["Fermat's Last Tango" in march 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Tango).

## Repository structure
The repository contains a "plot overview" file describing the order and key events of each scene, and a subfolder for all materials relating to each scene. 
The complete project should therefore be a collection of music,lyrics and speech - all of which is intended to be sourced from the community
For now we have initialized the plot with a sketch generated by [chat GPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/)...

## Contribution 
Constructive additions are welcomed from anyone who wishes to be involved, and a core team will merge these into main as deemed appropriate.
To avoid complicated merge conflicts (musicals are complicated!) if you intend to make large structural changes to the plot or organization of the project, please discuss this with the core team beforehand!
