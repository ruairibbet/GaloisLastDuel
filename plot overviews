1. Classroom
Galois, a young and brilliant mathematician, spends his school days with his childhood friend, Pescheux, engaging in playful mischief and taunting their teacher, Monsieur M. Guigniault. Meanwhile, Galois struggles to express his feelings for a girl named Stéphanie.

2. Exam/Interview I
The boys encounter Stéphanie outside the school. Pescheux successfully passes an important exam, while Galois fails. Consumed by jealousy, Galois fears that Stéphanie will be drawn to Pescheux instead.

3. École Normale I
Galois’s antagonistic teacher, Guigniault, has been promoted to the director of the prestigious École Normale. In an effort to make a name for himself, Galois submits groundbreaking mathematical papers to Cauchy, only to face rejection without explanation. Frustrated, Galois wrestles with the apparent injustice of the situation.

4. Exam/Interview II
At École Normale, Galois’s irritation reaches a boiling point as he faces increasingly nonsensical examinations. His frustration builds further when he experiences humiliations, including being hit by a rubber during an interview.

5. École Normale II
Locked in the school by Guigniault amidst a growing revolution outside, Galois longs to join his fellow revolutionaries. Driven by outrage, he writes an indictment of Guigniault, which is published in the Gazette des Écoles. In retaliation, Guigniault expels him from the institution.

6. Revolutionary Gathering
Finally free to express his anger, Galois joins a group of revolutionaries, where he meets Françoise-Vincent Raspail, a biologist. During a heated moment, he passionately shouts “To the King!”—a declaration that leads to his arrest.

7. Court
Galois stands trial for his revolutionary actions and for wearing the prohibited National Guard uniform. While his lawyer argues that Galois is a promising young man with great potential, the prosecution, led by the now-promoted Guigniault, counters by highlighting Galois’s inability to produce any substantial mathematical work.

8. Jail
Imprisoned, Galois is isolated from the world, his only solace coming from letters sent to him. He receives one from Stéphanie, apologizing for his incarceration, another from Pescheux, claiming to have stolen his girl, and a third from Poisson, expressing admiration for Galois’s work but requesting clarification of his complex theories. Desperate to regain Stéphanie’s affection and consumed by a sense of betrayal, Galois resolves to duel Pescheux in a bid to prove his worth, even if it means completing his mathematical works in one night. He confides his plans to his bewildered cellmate, Raspail.

9. Duel
The fateful duel occurs, and Galois is tragically killed by Pescheux, leaving his mathematical genius unfulfilled.

10. Poisson’s Office
In the aftermath of Galois’s death, the mathematician Poisson reflects on the tragic brilliance of Galois’s work, recognizing the significance of his contributions and lamenting that the world would never fully appreciate his genius. The story concludes with Poisson's acknowledgment of Galois’s legacy.
